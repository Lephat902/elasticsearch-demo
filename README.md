# Tiny Demo ElasticSearch App

## Introduction

This is a tiny demo app to experiment with concepts of ElasticSearch.
![Elasticsearch](https://techvccloud.mediacdn.vn/2018/10/15/elasticsearch-1539570535721747539902-0-50-832-1531-crop-15395705411511820530305.png)


## What-to-do

-   Set up a data source using traditional PostgreSQL.
-   Set up basic interactions with ElasticSearch.
-   Use LogStash to synchronize data from PostgreSQL to ElasticSearch.
-   Use Kibana to visualize and analyze data.
-   Explore advanced ElasticSearch features like:
    -   **Full-text search**: Implement powerful search capabilities.
    -   **Aggregations**: Perform complex data analysis.
    -   **Indexing**: Optimize data indexing for better performance.
    -   **Security**: Set up user authentication and role-based access control.

## How to Start

### Initial Setup

First, navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd elastic-search-demo
```

For the first-time setup, run the following commands:

1.  Create bind mount directories for volumes:
    
    ```sh
    mkdir -p es/logs es/data
    ```
    
2.  Grant the necessary permissions:
    
    ```sh
    chmod -R 777 es
    ```
    

### Running the App

To start the app, simply run:

```sh
docker compose up
```

## Using Kibana

Kibana is a powerful visualization tool that works with ElasticSearch. Here are some basic steps to get started:

1.  **Access Kibana**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5601`.
2.  **Create Index Patterns**: Define index patterns to visualize your data.
3.  **Visualize Data**: Use Kibanaâ€™s visualization tools to create charts, graphs, and dashboards.
4.  **Explore Discover**: Use the Discover feature to query and explore your data interactively.
